This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Client-side

In the project directory, run the client through:

### `npm run start`

## Server-side

In the directory `/src`, run the server by running:

### `node server.js`

To use the OpenAI API, store your API key in a new file called `/src/config.js`.
Use the following format:

#### `module.exports = { key: YOUR_API_KEY }`
